OpenAI Chatbot with Reddit Scraping Functionality

Hi there! I'm new to creating tools for other people, so if anything seems counterintuitive, you're likely not alone and I would love the feedback on aspects that don't feel natural.

I've built this primarily for:
(1) People who enjoy the shortcut to reddit scraping or find the Chatbot cool/useful 
(2) Developers, as well as anyone else who'd like to play around with code and build upon a project I've had a ton of fun making.
(3) My grandma, who is the most capable woman I know

How to use:
1. Locate your Reddit username and password
2. Go to api prefs, and log in
3. Create application -> script
4. Set name to whatever you'd like, this will be your user agent when filling out mysecrets.py
5. Locate the client id: String of characters written in the top left part of the small region for your application
6. Locate the client secret: Another string of characters written next to 'secret'
7. You should be all done using your browser! Paste these into their respective fields in mysecrets.py
8. Run mysecrets.py and note the printed string. This is reddit_token, please set it accordingly
9. You're all done with the essentials to run the scraper! Please try running test_setup.py
