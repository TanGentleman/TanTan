OpenAI Chatbot with Reddit Scraping Functionality

Hi there! I'm new to creating tools for other people, so if anything is even slightly counterintuitive, you're likely not alone and I would love feedback on absolutely anything that doesn't feel smooth or natural.

I've built this primarily for:
(1) People who enjoy the shortcut to reddit scraping or find the Chatbot cool/useful 
(2) Developers, as well as anyone else who'd like to play around with code and build upon a project I've had a ton of fun making.
(3) My grandma, who is the most capable woman I know

How to use:
1. Locate your Reddit username and password.
2. Go to api prefs
3. Create application -> script
4. Set name to whatever you'd like, this will be your user agent when filling out mysecrets.py
5. Locate the client id: String of characters written in the top left part of the small region for your application
6. Locate the client secret: Another string of characters written next to 'secret'
7. You should be all done using your browser! Paste these into their respective fields in mysecrets.py
8. Please run mysecrets.py
