OpenAI Chatbot with Reddit Scraping Functionality

Hi there! I'm new to creating tools for other people, so if anything is even slightly counterintuitive, you're likely not alone and I would love feedback on absolutely anything that doesn't feel smooth or natural.

I've built this primarily for:
(1) People who enjoy the shortcut to reddit scraping or find the Chatbot cool/useful 
(2) Developers, as well as anyone else who'd like to play around with code and build upon a project I've had a ton of fun making.
(3) My grandma, who is the most capable woman I know
